a)
When last item of array is < (length of array / 2)
    Copy array items and store in an array half the size
    Delete original array
    
This could be a problem if there's a scenario when items are repeatedly inserted and deleted around a 2^n index of the array because it would keep triggering the array to shrink and expand.

It would be fine if the array started large and then grew smaller over time.



b)
[looked up solution]
When array is 1/4 full, shrink to half its current size.
