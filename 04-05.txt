Scan through list of numbers and count the number of occurences of each number. O(n) time.

Store these counts in a hash table. If there's a known upper bound on the possible values for n numbers
then you can use the number itself as an index into the array. Otherwise, create a hash table of an
arbitrary size and has each value to store its count.

Find the max in the hash table. O(n) time. You could make it O(1) time if you keep track of the max
during each insertion/deletion. Either way, worst case is O(n) time. For the specific case of modes, allow multiple maxes.
